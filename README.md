# Public API Request
 Project 5
Awesome Startup needs a way to share the contact data of their remote employees. I have set up a get request to send to the API to recieve 12 employees data at a time. The user can search for each employee by name and click the employees card to view all their info opening the modal window. The modal window is focused view of that employee and your can scroll through the other employees on that page as well clicking the next and previous buttons.

Check it out it's pretty cool
